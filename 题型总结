1. Next Greater Element

739 - daily temperature, Next Greater Element I

1). Using Stack and HashMap 
if a new item is greater than the top value, put that in a hashmap 
if not, place on top of the Stack
hashmap stores the next greater element for each element

2. for Matrix problem [BFS]

Maze, Number of Island

1). set up an object
2). build visited boolean array
3). build direction array
4). build a queue
5). use queue template to do

3. clone graph / Clone N-ary Tree 

BFS Method:
1). create a visited hashmap (node, cloneNode)
2). create a queue to store all nodes
3). iterate through all neighbors, if visited hashmap contains this nei, put that in the children list that the clone node has; if not, create a clone node of this neighbor node

Do the BFS traversal.

Pop a node from the front of the queue.
Visit all the neighbors of this node.
If any of the neighbors was already visited then it must be present in the visited dictionary. Get the clone of this neighbor from visited in that case.
Otherwise, create a clone and store in the visited.
Add the clones of the neighbors to the corresponding list of the clone node.

DFS Template I:
/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(Node cur, Node target, Set<Node> visited) {
    return true if cur is target;
    for (next : each neighbor of cur) {
        if (next is not in visited) {
            add next to visted;
            return true if DFS(next, target, visited) == true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
